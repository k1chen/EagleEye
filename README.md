Hi! I'm Kenneth, a senior studying Computer Science at Boston College. Here's my final project for BZAN2165: Intro to Programming using Swift for iOS App Development. 

My app is Eagle Eye, an iOS app for students to report maintenance issues at various academic buildings across Boston College's main campus. I was inspired by complaints by my friends
and roommates, who are all heavy water-drinkers, that water fountains at Boston College were poorly maintained and rarely had their filters changed (it doesn't feel right to use them when the
filter icon is red!). Thus, the idea of Eagle Eye came to be, allowing students to report maintenance issues in any of the main academic buildings, giving them a title, floor, image and short
description. 

I built this with various techniques taught by Professor Gallaugher and was also heavily inspired by his SnacktackularUI app to understand how to work with Firebase and FirebaseStorage. 
These techniques include: 

<br> 1. Apple MapKit
<br> 2. Google Cloud Firestore
<br> 3. FirebaseStorage Image Sharing
<br> 4. MVVM Organization
<br> 5. Custom structs for data
<br> 6. Passing data between custom views. @StateObject, @EnvironmentObject
<br> 7. Map plotting
<br> 8. Live updates

<br> I want to give a special shoutout to Professor Gallaugher, CodingWithChris, Flo writes Code, and Apple's SwiftUI team. I referenced several of their video tutorials to assist me in
building this project, so without their instrumental help, none of this would have been possible.

Here are some sample images of my app:
